# Docker Overlay Networks

## What is an Overlay Network?

An overlay network is a Docker network type that allows containers running on **different Docker hosts** (different physical or virtual machines) to communicate with each other as if they were on the same local network.

It is built on top of the existing host network infrastructure — hence the name "overlay".

---

## Use Cases

- **Docker Swarm clusters** — the primary use case. Overlay networks are used by default when you deploy services in a Swarm.
- **Microservices across multiple hosts** — services like frontend, backend, and database can run on different machines but still communicate securely.
- **Multi-host deployments** — when a single host is not enough and you need to scale across servers.
- **Encrypted communication** — overlay networks support built-in encryption between nodes.

## How Overlay Networks Work

### Prerequisites

- Docker must be running in **Swarm mode** (`docker swarm init`)
- All hosts must be part of the same Swarm cluster

### Key Components

| Component     | Role                                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Swarm Manager | Controls the cluster and manages network state          |
| Worker Nodes  | Run containers and join the overlay network             |
| VXLAN         | Virtual Extensible LAN — tunnels traffic between hosts  |
| Control Plane | Uses gossip protocol to share network state             |
| Data Plane    | Actual container-to-container traffic via VXLAN tunnels |

### How it works step by step

1. You run `docker swarm init` on the manager node
2. Worker nodes join using `docker swarm join`
3. You create an overlay network: `docker network create -d overlay my-network`
4. Services attached to this network can reach each other by **container name**, regardless of which host they run on
5. Docker handles all the routing — containers use DNS to resolve service names

## Key Commands

```bash
# Initialize swarm
docker swarm init

# Join a worker node (run on worker)
docker swarm join --token <token> <manager-ip>:2377

# Create an overlay network
docker network create -d overlay my-overlay

# Deploy a service on overlay network
docker service create --name web --network my-overlay nginx

# List networks
docker network ls

# Inspect overlay network
docker network inspect my-overlay
```

## Overlay vs Bridge Network

| Feature        | Bridge                    | Overlay                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Scope          | Single host               | Multi-host                  |
| Use case       | Local dev / single server | Swarm / production clusters |
| Requires Swarm | No                        | Yes                         |
| Encryption     | No                        | Optional (--opt encrypted)  |
